As of February 2022, this project has no license. In the future, each project section will probably have its own license per the current OSHWA recommendation.

This is planned to take the following form:
 
|    Category   |    License    |
|   :--------:  |   :-------:   |
|    Hardware   | CERN OHL v1.2 |
|    Software   |   GPL v3.0    |
| Documentation | CC-BY-SA 4.0  |

Any information related to the Acrobammer project must fall under one of the three categories and therefore abide by the terms and conditions of a license. In ambiguous circumstances where a category cannot be easily identified, the least permissive license will apply.
